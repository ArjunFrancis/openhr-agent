## 🔥 BREAKTHROUGH FEATURES (Session 3)

### 1. **Rate Optimization Engine** ✨ NEW
**File:** `src/engines/optimization/RateOptimizer.js`

**What it does:**
- ML-powered algorithm to suggest optimal hourly rates
- Analyzes YOUR performance, market data, and demand signals
- Generates gradual increase strategies
- Provides rate increase scripts for clients

**How it works:**
```
Base Rate × Performance Multiplier × Demand Multiplier = Optimal Rate

Performance Multiplier:
- Top 10% (90th percentile) = 1.5x
- Top 25% (75th percentile) = 1.25x
- Below average (<50th) = 0.85x

Demand Multiplier:
- High demand (>0.85) = 1.15x
- Low demand (<0.65) = 0.90x
```

**Example Output:**
```
Current Rate: $65/hr
Optimal Rate: $95/hr
You're undercharging by 46%!

Strategy: Gradual Increase
1. Now: $72/hr (new clients)
2. 3 months: $82/hr
3. 6 months: $95/hr (target)
```

**Why revolutionary:** No competitor tells you what to charge or how to increase rates strategically
